# Getting Started with Coasts

If you haven't already, complete the install and requirements below first. Then this guide walks through using Coast in a project.

## Installing

- `brew install coast`
- `coast daemon install`

*If you decide not to run `coast daemon install`, you are responsible for starting the daemon manually with `coast daemon start` every single time.*

## Requirements

- macOS
- Docker Desktop
- A project using Git
- Node.js
- `socat` *(installed with `brew install coast` as a Homebrew `depends_on` dependency)*

Linux note: We have not tested Coasts on Linux yet, but Linux support is planned.
You can try to run Coasts on Linux today, but we do not provide guarantees that it will work correctly.
```

## Setting Up Coasts in a Project

Add a Coastfile to the root of your project. Make sure you are not on a worktree when installing.

```text
my-project/
├── Coastfile              <-- this is what Coast reads
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── src/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

The `Coastfile` points at your existing local development resources and adds Coasts-specific configuration — see the [Coastfiles documentation](coastfiles/README.md) for the full schema:

```toml
[coast]
name = "my-project"
compose = "./docker-compose.yml"

[ports]
web = 3000
db = 5432
```

A Coastfile is a lightweight TOML file that *typically* points to your existing `docker-compose.yml` (it also works with non-containerized local dev setups) and describes the modifications needed to run your project in parallel — port mappings, volume strategies, and secrets. Place it at your project root.

The fastest way to create a Coastfile for your project is to let your coding agent do it.

The Coasts CLI ships with a built-in prompt that teaches any AI agent the full Coastfile schema and CLI. You can view it here: [installation_prompt.txt](installation_prompt.txt)

Pass it directly to your agent, or copy the [installation prompt](installation_prompt.txt) and paste it into your agent's chat:

```bash-emphasis
# Claude Code
claude -p "$(coast installation-prompt)"

# Codex
codex "$(coast installation-prompt)"

# Cursor (from terminal)
cursor --chat "$(coast installation-prompt)"
```

The prompt covers the Coastfile TOML format, volume strategies, secret injection, and all relevant CLI commands. Your agent will analyze your project and generate a Coastfile.

## Your First Coast

Before starting your first Coast, bring down any running development environment. If you are using Docker Compose, run `docker-compose down`. If you have local dev servers running, stop them. Coasts manage their own ports and will conflict with anything already listening.

Once your Coastfile is ready:

```bash
coast build
coast run dev-1
```

Check that your instance is running:

```bash
coast ls

# NAME   PROJECT     STATUS   BRANCH  RUNTIME  WORKTREE  CO  ROOT
# dev-1  my-project  running  main    dind     -             ~/dev/my-project
```

See where your services are listening:

```bash
coast ports dev-1

# SERVICE    CANONICAL  DYNAMIC
# ★ web      3000       62217
#   db       5432       55681
```

Each instance gets its own set of dynamic ports so multiple instances can run side by side. To map an instance back to your project's canonical ports, check it out:

```bash
coast checkout dev-1
```

This means the runtime is now checked out and your project's canonical ports (like `3000`, `5432`) will route to this Coast instance.

```bash
coast ls

# NAME   PROJECT     STATUS   BRANCH  RUNTIME  WORKTREE  CO  ROOT
# dev-1  my-project  running  main    dind     -         ✓   ~/dev/my-project
```

To bring up the Coastguard observability UI for your project:

```bash
coast ui
```
