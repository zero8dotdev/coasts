# Shared Services

The `[shared_services.*]` sections define infrastructure services — databases, caches, message brokers — that run on the host Docker daemon rather than inside individual Coast containers. Multiple Coast instances connect to the same shared service over a bridge network.

For how shared services work at runtime, lifecycle management, and troubleshooting, see [Shared Services](../concepts_and_terminology/SHARED_SERVICES.md).

## Defining a shared service

Each shared service is a named TOML section under `[shared_services]`. The `image` field is required; everything else is optional.

```toml
[shared_services.postgres]
image = "postgres:16"
ports = [5432]
env = { POSTGRES_PASSWORD = "dev" }
```

### `image` (required)

The Docker image to run on the host daemon.

### `ports`

List of ports the service exposes. Used for bridge network routing between the shared service and Coast instances.

```toml
[shared_services.redis]
image = "redis:7-alpine"
ports = [6379]
```

Port values must be non-zero.

### `volumes`

Docker volume bind strings for persisting data. These are host-level Docker volumes, not Coast-managed volumes.

```toml
[shared_services.postgres]
image = "postgres:15"
ports = [5432]
volumes = ["infra_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data"]
```

### `env`

Environment variables passed to the service container.

```toml
[shared_services.postgres]
image = "postgres:15"
ports = [5432]
volumes = ["infra_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data"]
env = { POSTGRES_USER = "myapp", POSTGRES_PASSWORD = "myapp_pass", POSTGRES_DB = "mydb" }
```

### `auto_create_db`

When `true`, Coast automatically creates a per-instance database inside the shared service for each Coast instance. Defaults to `false`.

```toml
[shared_services.postgres]
image = "postgres:16"
ports = [5432]
env = { POSTGRES_PASSWORD = "dev" }
auto_create_db = true
```

### `inject`

Injects the shared service connection info into Coast instances as an environment variable or file. Uses the same `env:NAME` or `file:/path` format as [secrets](SECRETS.md).

```toml
[shared_services.postgres]
image = "postgres:16"
ports = [5432]
env = { POSTGRES_PASSWORD = "dev" }
inject = "env:DATABASE_URL"
```

## Lifecycle

Shared services start automatically when the first Coast instance that references them runs. They keep running across `coast stop` and `coast rm` — removing an instance does not affect shared service data. Only `coast shared rm` stops and removes a shared service.

Per-instance databases created by `auto_create_db` also survive instance deletion. Use `coast shared db drop` to remove them explicitly.

## When to use shared services vs volumes

Use shared services when multiple Coast instances need to talk to the same database server (e.g. a shared Postgres where each instance gets its own database). Use [volume strategies](VOLUMES.md) when you want to control how a compose-internal service's data is shared or isolated.

## Examples

### Postgres, Redis, and MongoDB

```toml
[shared_services.postgres]
image = "postgres:15"
ports = [5432]
volumes = ["infra_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data"]
env = { POSTGRES_USER = "myapp", POSTGRES_PASSWORD = "myapp_pass", POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES = "dev_db,test_db" }

[shared_services.redis]
image = "redis:7"
ports = [6379]
volumes = ["infra_redis_data:/data"]

[shared_services.mongodb]
image = "mongo:latest"
ports = [27017]
volumes = ["infra_mongodb_data:/data/db"]
env = { MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME = "myapp", MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD = "myapp_pass" }
```

### Minimal shared Postgres

```toml
[shared_services.postgres]
image = "postgres:16-alpine"
ports = [5432]
env = { POSTGRES_USER = "coast", POSTGRES_PASSWORD = "coast", POSTGRES_DB = "coast_demo" }
```

### Shared services with auto-created databases

```toml
[shared_services.db]
image = "postgres:16-alpine"
ports = [5432]
env = { POSTGRES_USER = "coast", POSTGRES_PASSWORD = "coast" }
auto_create_db = true
```
