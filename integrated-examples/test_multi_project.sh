# Multi-project integration test for coast.
#
# Runs two coast projects simultaneously (coast-demo and coast-api) on the
# same machine. Verifies they don't interfere, that `coast ls` shows
# all instances with their project roots.
#
# Test 5 uses `coast assign` to switch an instance to feature-v2 and verifies
# the branch-specific response.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Docker running
#   - socat installed (brew install socat)
#   - Coast binaries built (cargo build --release)
#
# Usage:
#   ./integrated_examples/test_multi_project.sh
